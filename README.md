# What exactly is Shuffle Board?
                                 
Hectic schedules seem to be a constant in today’s society, and with that in mind we plan to create a tool 
that maximizes the potential of one’s time; we plan to create Shuffle Board. Shuffle Board is an app that will 
allow users to see possible daily schedules based on what they need, and would like, to accomplish in their 
time. The app will allow the user to “set times” and “shuffle times,” that is to say a user can outline specific, 
immutable events with set times, or add events into time ranges. Once these events are set, the app will generate 
different possible schedule permutations based on those parameters. In addition, Shuffle Board will also allow for
a user to “mesh” their schedule with other users’ schedules to the effect of quickly and efficiently finding times
that users have in common, such that a new event or meeting can be conveniently scheduled.

## Now let us take into consideration the all-too common case of Billy: 
                  
Billy is extremely busy this coming week, with events, meetings, chores around the house, and running errands.  
He has tried putting together a schedule with paper and pencil and has finally found a schedule that will work 
well enough.  Then he learns of another meeting he is expected to be at in the middle of the week.  He looks at his 
schedule and knows it will be a lot of work to accommodate this new addition.  This is where Shuffle Board would be 
helpful. If he had been using Shuffle Board, Billy could have easily entered in this new meeting to his list of events, 
and then looked at his available options. Shuffle Board will adapt to the new event and display his options for a 
schedule. 

# Unique things about Shuffle Board 
                        
While Shuffle Board shares key features of other schedule/planner applications (such as creating, editing, and 
removing events), the key differences will be the ability to effectively find a common time with other users for various
events, and a self-generating slew of schedule options given to the user, allowing the user to adopt schedules that 
otherwise may have gone undiscovered. Shuffle Board will be comparable to Slate Permutate, although while the latter is 
restricted to creating options for registration, Shuffle Board will be able to organizing the entire schedule of the user, 
with more customization options.

In essence, Shuffle Board will help people with busy schedules find a way to accomplish everything on their list without the 
need of dropping low priority items, including meeting with other of their busy comrades.
